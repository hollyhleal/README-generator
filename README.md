# README Generator

In this project, I created a command-line application to easily generate a README file. I completed the following:

1. Developed a command-line application that accepts user input
2. When the user is prompted, they will answer a series of questions about their application repository that then generates a high-quality, professional README.md containing the project title and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
3. When the user enters their project title, this title is displayed as the title of the README
4. When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
5. When the user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
6. When the user enters their GitHub username, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
7. When the user enters their email address, then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
8. When clicking on the Table of Contents, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README

This application can be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```
